        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * The `age` column has a missing value (`None`). Instead of leaving it as `None`, we replace it with the **median** value of the `age` column. This ensures that we don't lose data and avoid errors in subsequent steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Creation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * We create a new feature `salary_per_age`, which is simply the **salary** divided by the **age**. This can give us an idea of how much someone earns relative to their age.\n",
        "   * We also extract the **year** and **month** from the `date` column, which can be useful for any time-based analysis (e.g., trends across months or years).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * The `city` column contains text data (categorical data). Machine learning models cannot directly work with text, so we need to convert it into numerical data.\n",
        "   * We use **one-hot encoding** with `pd.get_dummies()`. This will create separate columns for each city (e.g., `city_Delhi`, `city_Mumbai`, `city_Chennai`), where the column gets a `1` if the city matches, otherwise a `0`. This is a common technique for handling categorical variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Scaling Numerical Features**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Features like `age`, `salary`, and `salary_per_age` may have very different scales. For example, salary can be in the tens of thousands, while age is in the twenties to thirties. If we don't scale them, the model might give more importance to features with larger values.\n",
        "   * **StandardScaler** standardizes the features, so they all have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This makes them comparable and helps many machine learning algorithms perform better.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Label Encoding (Using Numbers)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Label Encoding** is a technique where each unique category is assigned a **numerical value**. For example, in the case of the `city` column, the cities could be encoded as:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Delhi → 0\n",
        "* Mumbai → 1\n",
        "* Chennai → 2\n",

        "[0, 1, 0, 2]\n",
        "```\n",

        "#### **Why Use Label Encoding?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Simple and efficient**: It's easier to implement because it just assigns a number to each category. This is helpful if you have many categories, and you want to keep the dataset compact (i.e., fewer columns).\n",
        "* **Works well for ordinal data**: If your categories have a **natural order**, like **\"Low\" < \"Medium\" < \"High\"**, then Label Encoding is perfect. Here, \"Low\" could be 0, \"Medium\" could be 1, and \"High\" could be 2, meaning the number itself carries meaningful information.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Why Not Use Label Encoding for Cities?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **No inherent order**: In the case of cities, there is **no natural order** between them. Delhi is not \"greater\" or \"lesser\" than Mumbai, and Mumbai is not \"greater\" or \"lesser\" than Chennai. These are just names of places with no meaningful ranking.\n",
        "* **Misleading for models**: When you apply Label Encoding to non-ordinal data like cities, machine learning algorithms might incorrectly assume that one city is somehow \"greater\" or \"less\" than another. For example, if you assign Delhi as `0`, Mumbai as `1`, and Chennai as `2`, the model might think that Chennai is \"greater\" than Mumbai, which doesn’t make sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **One-Hot Encoding (Using Binaries)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**One-Hot Encoding** turns each category into a **new column**, where each column represents a different category, and the value is either `1` or `0`. So, for the `city` column, instead of having one column for `city`, you create three columns:\n",

        "* `city_Chennai`\n",

        "#### **Why Use One-Hot Encoding?**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* **More columns**: One-Hot Encoding can increase the size of the dataset significantly, especially if you have a lot of categories (e.g., if there were 100 cities, you'd create 100 columns!). This can be inefficient and may lead to higher computational costs.\n",
        "* **Sparsity**: Since most of the values will be `0` (with only one `1` per row), your dataset will become sparse (i.e., filled mostly with zeroes), which can sometimes make processing less efficient.\n",

        "* **For Ordinal Data**: If the categories have a **natural order** (like \"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"), Label Encoding is good. For example, if the data was about the **size of a product**, Label Encoding would make sense because the sizes have an order.\n",
        "* **For a large number of categories**: If you have **lots of unique categories** (e.g., 100 different cities), Label Encoding can be more memory-efficient since it adds just one column instead of many.\n",

        "#### **When to Use One-Hot Encoding**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **For Nominal (Non-Ordered) Data**: Since cities don’t have a natural order (Delhi isn’t “greater” than Chennai, and Chennai isn’t “less” than Mumbai), **One-Hot Encoding** is the right choice for cities.\n",
